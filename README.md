# Getting Started with React + TypeScript, eslint, prettier, and Material Ui

This is a simple boiler plate made with create-react-app.
It includes, TypeScript, eslint, and prettier.

The linting script will:
a.) run eslint rules
b.) run prettier and reformat the code based on the eslint rules.

In the terminal, simply run:

# ESLINT

## `npm run lint`

# PRETTIER

## `npm run format`

The boilerplate also has the vscode configurations to run eslint and prettier on saving changes to files.
In case this feature isn't working, you may need to check that the vscode configutions are set.

## Material Ui

A theme provider is included and a styled component for the LandingContainer which can be found in src/components/Landing/styled.
Both of these pieces are in the boiler plate to show which props do what.
